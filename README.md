## Week 4 - Local Development & Deployment

### Learning Activities & Resources

This week, I focused on setting up a local development environment and deploying a dynamic site with a database using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

### Learning Resources

- [W3Schools PHP MySQL Connect](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_connect.asp)
- [Official MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)
- [Apache HTTP Server Documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/)

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately 6 hours learning and setting up the local development environment and deploying the site.

## Content Insights

Setting up the LAMP stack provided a comprehensive understanding of the core components needed for dynamic web development. Here are some key insights:
